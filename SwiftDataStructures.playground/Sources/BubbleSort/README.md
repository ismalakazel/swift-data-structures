# Bubble Sort
 
The bubble sort algorithm loops though an array and compares if the array element n is bigger than n+1. When true, n and n+1
are swapped, and the loop continues until the biggest element in the array is moved to the last index. Then, the process is 
repeated until all elements in the array are put in ascending order.
